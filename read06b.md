**What is a computer?**
A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.

**how does computer work?**
computers are about input, memory, processing, and output, all the junk on your desk makes a lot more sense

*What makes a computer a computer?*
There are basic building blocks to a computer, which, like Lego bricks, can be combined in billions of different ways to make loads of different things. But unlike Lego, these building blocks don’t have to look the same. They could be links on a chain or mechanical gears or pulses of electricity. What they have in common is that they respond to different inputs in different ways.
