# logical operators
 ## how we can make a comparison operators evaluating conditions ?
we can evaluate conditions by comparing one value in the script with what you expect it might be result boolean true or false 

comparison operators usually return single values of true or false while logical operators  will allow you to compear the results of more than one comparison operator  .

*exambles on operator* we have a lot of operators like :

* == is equal to
* '>' grater than
* != not equal to
* === strict equal to
* !== strict not equal to
* <= grater than or equal
* '>=' less than or equal
* < less than .

**now what are logical operators?**
logical operators are elemants use to  help you  to compare of results of more than one comparsion operator.for examble :
* || 
* ! 
* && 
if structure **what is look like?**
 * if (condition) **followed by** { code to see if value is true; }

 ## loops :
  its used to  check a condition we have two main :
  * For
* while
