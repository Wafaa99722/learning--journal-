# Version Control
## Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes
Through version control we can do :
1. revert a file or project to a previous version 
2. track modifications and modifying individuals 
3. compare changes
## Local Version Control : entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files
## Centralized Version Control:This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.
## Distributed Version Control :addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS
## what is Git:
1.Snapshots
2.Local Operations
4.Tracking Changes
5.Loss of Data
6.States
## three main states of files in git: 
committed, modified and staged.
