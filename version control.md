# Version Control
## Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes
Through version control we can do :
1. revert a file or project to a previous version 
2. track modifications and modifying individuals 
3. compare changes
## Local Version Control : entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files
