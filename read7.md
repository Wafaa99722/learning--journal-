**JavaScript**
it  is the programming language of HTML and the Web its easy to learn.
 Why Study JavaScript?
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
  1. HTML to define the content of web pages
   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
    3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages


*JavaScript syntax* : 
 refers to a set of rules that determine how the language will be written (by the programmer) and interpreted (by the browser).


 when you learn JavaScript you will understand some terms such as variables, functions, statements, operators, data types, objects etc.

 operatorsits rely with expression, they  help programmers to create a single value from one or more values 
 so what kind of operators we have ?
* assignment operator: assign a value to a variable.
* compression operator: compare to value and return true or false.
* arithmetic operator: per form basic math.
 * logical operator: combine expression and return true or false.
 * string operator: combine tow strings.

**functions** : 
it help you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
